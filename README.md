## RESOURCES

- [original repo (by saiteja-madha)](https://github.com/saiteja-madha/discord-js-bot) - comes with awesome utilities right out of the box! (ie. safeSend, resolveMember). at this point the repo i cloned is nearly unrecognizeable, so i highly suggest you go check out the original for a fully featured bot.
- [embed builder](https://autocode.com/tools/discord/embed-builder) - closely resembles djs' [embed constructor](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#embed-preview)
- [discord.js docs](https://github.com/discordjs/guide)
